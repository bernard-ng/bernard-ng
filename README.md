## About Me

I've been a software developer since 2015, specializing in systems modeling and design, working mainly as a backend on projects although I have fullstack skills. I'm an opensource maintainer and contributor in the PHP ecosystem (Symfony framework), interested in data science and artificial intelligence.

I'm also the founder and leader of the Devscast community, the Google Developer Student Club Lead at Universit√© Nouveaux Horizons (2022-2023), and zindi.africa Ambassador for the DRC (2022-2024).

my goal in communities has always been to make an impact; to push back the limits of what we're capable of building, to change the world's perception of African and Congolese developers in particular, through a variety of community activities.
