## About Me

I'm a software developer since 2015, specialized in system modeling and design, I work mainly as a backend on projects although I have fullstack skills. Maintainer and opensource contributor in the PHP ecosystem, interested in data science and artificial intelligence.


I dream of gaining the freedom to help people through new products, to help them grow through experience and to achieve their dreams and independence. For me, software development is a form of expression, I can't agree more that software development is an art


I am also the founder and leader of the Devscast community, the Google Developer Student Club Lead of New Horizons University (2022-2023), Ambassador zindi.africa for the DRC (2022-2023), Francophone Translator for freecodecamp. org the world's first programming learning platform, my goal in the communities has always been to impact; to push the limits of what we are capable of building, to change the perception that the world has towards African and Congolese developers in particular and this through community activities such as workshops, live session, content production
